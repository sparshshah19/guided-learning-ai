# Guided Thinking React App (simplified)

This project keeps only the basics:

1. **Brain Dump:** write at least 30 words about your topic to unlock the next step.
2. **Question Draft:** refine a focused question.
3. **Practice:** review your topic and question, then keep writing notes—no API calls involved.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

That is it. Everything happens in the browser with simple React state.
